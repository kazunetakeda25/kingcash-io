got ?

Yes

and about lending

i think we can limit to $25 and use last 10 trade

----

attacker wont know if we have this mechanism right? (10 trade lowest)

if we still face any problem, then we will check but i dont think we will have any issue



limit to $25, means, if last 10 trade lowest price is larger than $25, then set 1KCP = $25 USD?

Only for lending.

trading it can be even $50.. but we will give lending rate only at $25 maximum

like if last 10 trades happenee d at $26 .. we will still offer lending at $25 only

Yes, I understand
I will do like that.


Thank you
