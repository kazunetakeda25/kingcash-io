Referral system:

Referrer is one who gives his link
Referral is one who sign up under referrer

================================


When anyone makes new account, they will get their own referral link. (referral link is generated based on their own username)



If username is arun, then their referral link will be

when user gives his referral link to others and they signup using his link, then they become his referral.


User should be able to see all the people who signed up under him (All people who he referred should be in "Referrals" page). It should be like this

downlines means number of people who signup under that person.

The referals should show usernames of people who signed up under him. Those usernames shud be clickable and clicking in username below those should further further show others like a chain
